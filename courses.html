        <p>These are my classes I have taken or will be taking:</p>
        
        <h2>CIS1500 - Intro to Programming (Java)</h2>
        <p style="border:1px dashed"></p>
        <p>In this class we learned about the fundamentals of programming with Java while working on assignments and projects.
            The most notable project that I remember is the project where we had to use SceneBuilder to make a grocery list.</p>
        
        <h2>CIS1512 - Software Engineering</h2>
        <p style="border:1px dashed"></p>
        <p>In this class we learned about UML, the SDLC, iterative development models, etc. The most memorable project in the class
            was when me and my group members took the idea of a <a href="https://superg3m.itch.io/ruins-of-time"> card game </a> 
            and put it into a digital card game based on another card game for reference.
        </p>
    
        <h2>CIS2151</h2>
        <p style="border:1px dashed"></p>
        <p>This class is an extension from Intro to Programming and we learned that are not limited to: </p>
        <ul style='align-content: center'>
            <li style='align-content: center'>exception handling</li>
            <li style='align-content: center'>file input and output</li>
            <li style='align-content: center'>composition</li>
            <li style='align-content: center'>inheritance</li>
            <li style='align-content: center'>polymorphism</li>
            <li style='align-content: center'>abstract</li>
            <li style='align-content: center'>classes</li>
            <li style='align-content: center'>interfaces</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>CIS1420</h2>
        <p style="border:1px dashed"></p>
        <p>This course focuses on designing and coding internet web pages using HTML5. 
            The student will develop web pages by designing, entering, and testing code using this standard (with a simple text editor) rather than by using web development tools. 
            Topics include - HTML5 element structure, web forms, multimedia, style sheets (CSS3) to apply formatting and layout characteristics in addition to applying special effects. 
            This course will also include an introduction to the JavaScript programming language.
            Students should be familiar with the basics of both word processing and Windows file management techniques before enrolling in this course.
        </p>
        
        <h2>CIS2353</h2>
        <p style="border:1px dashed"></p>
        <p>Students will investigate the programming techniques and theories involved in implementing linked lists, queues, stacks and tree structures. 
            Recursion, searching techniques and sorting algorithms will also be considered.
            Students will be required to complete computer-based assignments inside and outside of class.
        </p>
